		Ill try and get some actual coaching photos at some point but for now you've got some place holders there. Feel free to scrub my FB too, 
		I've gone to striking shirts for a logo/shirt stuff because mint had nothing after 3 months ðŸ™ƒ

		Im thinking of marketing myself as high level coaching for a reasonable price. Pitch it is as 
		I want to work with as many people as possible. I'm sure you can spin that into something short and sweet.

		My rates Â£20 an hour for individual, Â£30 for groups up to 4. Anything larger is available but on a 
		custom basis. Non of this includes lane fee and is all in shipley.

				<p>No bulk buys - I want you to want to be here every lesson. Sometimes when students bulk buy lessons
