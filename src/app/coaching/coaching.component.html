		Ill try and get some actual coaching photos at some point but for now you've got some place holders there. Feel free to scrub my FB too, 
		I've gone to striking shirts for a logo/shirt stuff because mint had nothing after 3 months ðŸ™ƒ

		Im thinking of marketing myself as high level coaching for a reasonable price. Pitch it is as 
		I want to work with as many people as possible. I'm sure you can spin that into something short and sweet.

		My rates Â£20 an hour for individual, Â£30 for groups up to 4. Anything larger is available but on a 
		custom basis. Non of this includes lane fee and is all in shipley.

			<h1 style="">About Me</h1>
		<p>
			I am a passionate and dedicated bowling coach with a proven track record of success both as an 
			athlete and a mentor. My journey began with a gold-medal-winning performance at the 2019 Youth 
			Triple Crown U22 Boys, where I claimed top honors in Singles, Doubles, Team, All Events, and the 
			Overall Cup. This foundation of competitive excellence has fueled my commitment to developing the 
			next generation of elite bowlers.From 2019 to 2024, I proudly served as a coach for Team England, 
			working closely with players to plan development strategies, oversee progress, and provide hands-on 
			guidance. During this time, I also held the position of Head Coach in 2022 and led 
			Team England to medal-winning performances at major international tournaments, including the 2023 
			European Youth Championships in Vienna (bronze in Boys Masters, Girls Team, and Boys Team) and the 
			2024 EYC in Helsinki (gold in Girls Doubles, bronze in Girls Singles). I served as a training coach 
			throughout the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 2020 to 2021, ensuring that players stayed 
			motivated and progressed despite unprecedented circumstances. Currently, I am deeply involved 
			in the sport as Team Englandâ€™s Squad Coach, actively participating in all training sessions and 
			supporting athletes at every stage of their journey. Whether on the lanes or behind the scenes, 
			I am driven by a commitment to excellence, a passion for player development, and a belief in the 
			power of teamwork to achieve greatness.

			<h1>Achievements</h1> 
			
			<p>With a decorated career spanning over a decade, I bring elite-level experience 
				and expertise to my coaching business. As a 3-time National Champion, I 
				have consistently demonstrated excellence at the highest levels of 
				competition. Representing the Men's National Team in both 2022 and 2023 
				and competing in the U22 World Championships in 2018, I have gained valuable 
				international experience. Since 2018, I have competed on the prestigious European 
				Bowling Tour, honing my skills against some of the worldâ€™s best athletes. 
				<br><br>	
				Additionally, my experience assisting as a Pro Shop Operator equips me with deep 
				technical knowledge of equipment and its impact on performance, enabling me to 
				offer personalized, professional guidance to bowlers of all levels. My passion 
				is to share these skills and insights to help others achieve their goals on the lanes.

				rather than feeling obligated due to a pre-paid commitment. Training should be something you 
				look forward to, not something you feel tied to. Iâ€™m fully committed to your development 
				and success, but itâ€™s just as important that youâ€™re equally committed to your journey. Letâ€™s 
				grow together, one session at a time.</p>
